Hand signs:
Rock: Make a fist with your hand.
Paper: Hold your hand out flat.
Scissors: Extend your pointer finger and middle finger in a V shape.
How to win:
Rock crushes Scissors.
Paper covers Rock.
Scissors cut Paper.
Playing: We can both say "rock, paper, scissors, shoot!" at the same time, then throw out our hand signs. Or, you can tell me your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and I'll randomly generate mine.
Are you ready to play?  Let me know if you'd like to choose your hand sign first, or if you want me to go first.
